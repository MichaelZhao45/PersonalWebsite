<h1> The Start - January 11, 2024 </h1>
This is the start of my project, where I will be designing a personal portfolio website for myself

- Implemented basic layout of sections and blocks to fill in
- Started on the CSS and HTML, working on the navigation and the information that I generally want to be displayed
- Overall just starting, more progress soon

<h1> About Section + Nav Bar - January 15, 2024 </h1>

Got some solid work done today, roughly 75 mins of good work.  The project is coming along, can't wait to keep working on it!

About Section
- Added Icons to each section
- Added Information for each section
- Styled the section, font-size increase, etc

Nav Bar
- Made hover, change colour when you hover over the link
- Increased font-size for links

<h1> Experience and Contact Section + Ideas and Prep - January 16, 2024 </h1>

Finished the experiences section and started on the contact section.  

I also did some thinking about where I want to proceed with the website.  Which includes but is not limited to: 
- Profile Picture
- Icon Links in the Contact Section
- Nav Bar Better Hover
- Footer (maybe)
- Different colour way for the website (maybe)
